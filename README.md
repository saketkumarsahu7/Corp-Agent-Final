# Corp-Agent: Autonomous Enterprise Support System

### 🚀 Overview
**Corp-Agent** is a domain-specific GenAI prototype designed to automate enterprise workflows. Built with **Java Spring Boot** and **Agentic AI principles**, it serves as a "Small Language Model" (SLM) simulator tailored for corporate environments.

### 🔑 Key Features
* **Domain-Specific Logic:** Pre-trained with 150+ enterprise data points (HR Policy, IT Protocols, Strategic IP).
* **Agentic Workflow:** Simulates intent recognition to distinguish between "Information Retrieval" (e.g., Leave Policy) and "Actionable Tasks" (e.g., Password Reset).
* **Tech Stack:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, JavaScript (REST API).
* **Architecture:** Modular, scalable, and cloud-ready design.
